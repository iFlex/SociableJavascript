Modules:

Main Loop:

  - Shared datastructure representing V8 Instances
    - Command Parser
      - Request Builder
        - Serializer
          - socket

    - Response Parser
      - socket
        - Deserialiser
          - Evaluator


Grouping

Entities:
  Machine
    V8 Process
      Isolate

Assumptions:
  If a memory limit is not imposed per machine, the Main Memory Size will be used.
  A memory hard limit can be set per Machine,V8 or Isolate.
    Isolate: if a hard limit is set per Isolate, The algorithm will include it in the limitations imposed on the parent V8.
    V8:      if a hard memory limit is set per Machine, algorithm will consider all isolates as part of the same V8
    Machine: if memory limit is set per V8, an instance of the algorithm will run for that V8 without knowledge of the other V8s
  An instance of the algorithm will run for each machine.
