1) figure out how to restrict heap size of context (for whole v8 instance)
2) find the minimum heap size required for each benchmark ( binary search )
3) graph - max heap size to mean execution time
DONE>> 4) matplotlib
5) rerun same benchmark to ensure heap size is correct - js wrappers
DONE>> 6) Update Readme
7) Make js wrappers for tests, so that only one benchmark is loaded

DONE >> 8) Pithon live plotting class - need to make class instance it own the plot window
